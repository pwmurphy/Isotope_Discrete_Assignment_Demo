Isotope Discrete Assignment Tutorial
=============

This is a brief tutorial for discrete origin assignment using a subset of Wisconsin mallard feather samples, following code developed by Drew Fowler and Jay Winiarski. The tutorial was put together for project partners and collaborators for the WI/MN DNR waterfowl harvest derivation project. This repository houses all the data and files necessary to run the discrete origin assignment tutorial in R. Follow the steps below: 

## 1. Install R, if needed

Download and install/update [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/). 

## 2. Tutorial R script and accompanying html file

If you'd like to go through the tutorial on your machine, navigate to this page that outlines the assignment process and follow along by downloading the R script containing the step-by-step code. The code in the R script matches the code run in the html document, sans detailed descriptions.
