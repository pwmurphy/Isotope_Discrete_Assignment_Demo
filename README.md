Isotope Discrete Assignment Tutorial
=============

This is a brief tutorial for discrete origin assignment using a subset of Wisconsin mallard feather samples from Wisconsin-harvested mallards. In this tutorial, we will go through the steps to assign feather samples a region of origin: ‘local’ versus non-local (‘northern’ or ‘southern’) bird origin. There is also a small component about relating timing of harvest to origin location.

The tutorial was put together for project partners and collaborators on the WI/MN DNR waterfowl harvest derivation project. All necessary data is provided and all other data and plots will be generated within R. Code based off code written by Drew Fowler.

## 1. Install R, if needed

Download and install/update [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/). 

## 2. Tutorial R script and accompanying html file

If you'd like to go through the tutorial on your machine, navigate to [this page](https://pwmurphy.github.io/Isotope_Discrete_Assignment_Demo/iso_discrete_assignment_tutorial.html) that outlines the assignment process and follow along by downloading the [R script](https://github.com/pwmurphy/Isotope_Discrete_Assignment_Demo/blob/main/iso_discrete_assignment_tutorial.R) containing the step-by-step code. The code in the R script matches the code run in the html document, sans detailed descriptions.
